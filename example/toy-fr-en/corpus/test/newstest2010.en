Barack Obama becomes the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
The American president Barack Obama will fly into Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, the fourth American president in history to do so.
He will receive a diploma, medal and cheque for 1.4 million dollars for his exceptional efforts to improve global diplomacy and encourage international cooperation, amongst other things.
The head of the White House will be flying into the Norwegian city in the morning with his wife Michelle and will have a busy schedule.
First, he will visit the Nobel Institute, where he will have his first meeting with the five committee members who selected him from 172 people and 33 organisations.
The presidential couple then has a meeting scheduled with King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway.
Then, in the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a grand ceremony, at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American president to be awarded the prize, and only the third to have received it while actually in office.
The White House has stated that, when he accepts the prize, Obama will speak about the war in Afghanistan.
The president does not want to skirt around this topic, as he realises that he is accepting the prize as a president whose country is currently at war in two countries.
A few days ago he stepped up the war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan, something that his critics will be stressing.
At the ceremony, Obama will also be given a gold medal, a diploma, and a cheque for ten million Swedish krona (around 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate this money to charity, but hasn't decided which yet.
Their busy schedule will then take the president and his wife to a banquet, which will be attended by the Norwegian king and queen as well as the ministerial chairman and another 250 invited guests.
Obama has always been reticent in regards to his prize.
He has said, for example, that he feels that he does not wholly deserve it.
He has repeatedly said that the prize isn't for him, but for everyone who upholds the same values.
Right after hearing about it, he described it as a "challenge to take action."
Nature protection officers accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police have accused the chairman of the Litoměřice Nature Protection Society civil association of blackmail.
Several times during the last year he appealed against certain building permit proceedings, and has then claimed money from investors for retracting the appeal, said Litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The chairman of the Litoměřice Nature Protection Society is Lubomír Studnička.
He is now under arrest and faces up to three years in prison.
Recycling containers don't smell so good in Brno
In Prague, normal people can sort their beverage bottles, and, in South Moravian, villages are recycling containers on every corner.
And in Brno?
There, it will take you a good few minutes to find the right sort of bin.
I don't mean to imply that garbage isn't sorted in Brno.
But it seems to me that considering we're the second largest city in the country, the authorities are not showing enough interest in this problem.
Brno is falling way behind in its garbage sorting, not only because people here can still only put paper, glass and plastic into these bins, but mostly because of the sheer lack of containers for this kind of waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle into a bin in the city centre?
It's a real art form, and you need time and steady nerves.
The only place we've managed to come across is on Moravské náměstí, opposite the Potrefená Husa.
No offence to Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but it's really not good enough.
Not to mention that it's no easy task sorting garbage in other parts of the city.
Plenty of my friends don't bother sorting their garbage.
Out of laziness.
It's just too far to the bin, you see.
I don't blame them.
After a party, I offered to throw out a few glass and plastic bottles.
But, on Kounicova ulice, there were no coloured bins to be seen.
Luckily, on the way to the tram, I found the right place.
But it was overflowing with garbage.
Come on, this is the centre of Brno. Isn't it supposed to look good?
It should, but ecology and aesthetics don't seem to interest the Brno socialists much.
They prefer to buy the city a new hockey extra-league, which puts us to shame all over the country, instead of buying a few more containers and letting us sort other garbage for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad to see that, after browsing the net for a while, my assumptions are confirmed by official statistics.
Figures published by EKO-KOM show that Brno really is the worst off in the whole of South Moravia.
"Paroubek's" budget takes money for pensions and sick pay
The fact that the left gave extra money to the farmers and civil servants in the face of government opinion means that there might not be enough money in the budget to cover pensions, sick pay, or building society savings.
And also not enough for interest on the national debt or to cover international judicial disputes.
This will bring problems for whoever is in office in the latter half of next year, said the Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists raised interest rates for certain groups, they were relying on the fact that the government would loan money for susceptible expenses, pensions, and sick pay. "It's just a case of postponing the problem, laying a minefield," says Janota.
Higher interest has to be paid on loaned money, and, at some point, it has to be paid back.
The state does not have much choice where to find it.
If it doesn't reduce social benefits or the costs of running the state, it will have to increase taxes.
For all those that the left just handed out money to: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, their children, too.
People don't have to worry about pensions or sick pay, where 1.8 billion has disappeared from the accounts; they'll get them.
Although, at the cost of the state falling deeper into debt – next year the treasury won't just be 163 billion short, but even more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will continue to increase at an ever faster rate, as will interest costs.
The state will need money to cover it, and it's no longer enough just to slightly bump up VATs or reduce maternity benefits, as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
As money has been diverted to several groups of voters, next year there will also be a shortage of five billion for building highways and railways.
These are mostly sections that have been tendered out and are half-finished and cannot be redesigned or made any cheaper.
At the most, conserve what isn't free too.
This means that delaying or halting thirty major building projects and money from European funds is also at risk, warns transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The ČSSD has suggested that the deficit be resolved Solomon-style – it should draw on ČEZ dividends, which are mostly state-owned, and use those to top up the transport fund.
The problem is that the level of these dividends is never certain, and they are certainly not a bottomless resource.
Last year, 18 billion of ČEZ money went into the budget.
Every year, these dividends are used to pay for clearing up ecological damage, topping up the pensions account, or are set aside as a reserve for the upcoming pension reforms.
Moreover, according to EU regulations, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP.
But this is not the end of these transfers.
The budget is almost three billion shot to cover various damages owed to the victims of communism and crime, to meet the cost of judicial disputes, and even to cover building society savings.
It is still not clear if the state can get by without this money.
It's a gamble.
If we were to lose an international dispute, we'd still have to pay, claims Janota.
The minister will then have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case scenario, reach into the government's budget reserve.
The two-billion-crown State Treasury project, which is already underway, is also lacking a hundred million, and what each office is spending can be followed on-line.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister can't find the money elsewhere, the project will have to be aborted and sanctions will be imposed, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will run two operating systems
The Americans are saying that, in the future, users will be able to switch between different operating systems on their mobile phones at the touch of a button.
The plans revealed so far look promising.
Just press one key and in just a few seconds you can switch from Windows Mobile to Android.
This is the goal of the American company Vmware, which primarily develops computer virtualisation software.
This will let you have two user profiles at once on the same phone.
You can switch between them or have one for work and one for home.
Both of them will run at the same time, says Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computer World magazine.
It was presented last November and first demonstrated just a few days ago.
It will go on sale in 2012.
The virtualisation of smartphones is not science fiction.
VMware has already given reporters a demonstration of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified N800 with 128 MB of RAM, running Windows Mobile and Android at the same time.
The development of new mobile phone technology is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test smartphone virtualisation and the sets should reach customers sometime during 2012.
Lack of snow in mountains causes problems for hoteliers
It's not only Krkonoše ski-lift operators who are worried by these bare slopes.
The lack of snow is putting people off booking ski holidays in hotels and guest houses.
This means vacancies are still available in the Krkonoše throughout the winter, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We're getting plenty of visitors to our site.
People are browsing the offers, checking prices, but, so far, are worried about making a definite booking.
"When they call, the first thing they ask is if we think they'll see snow or mud," says Martin Jandura, who runs the Spindl.Info information web site.
Anyone who wants to spend New Year's Eve in Špindlerův Mlýn just how they want, had better start thinking about booking soon.
Those preferring to save money and go for cheaper accommodation can still give it a few days.
Hoteliers in Špindlerův Mlýn are so far just offering week-long stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they'll try to keep that up for a while, but even they will give in and offer shorter stays.
Then there'll be a sudden shortage of vacancies," estimates Jandura.
The Vrchlabí travel agency Ingtours is still offering vacancies throughout the winter.
What we’re interested in is Christmas week, which hasn't sold out yet.
Half of our capacity is still available.
That's why we've been preparing some cheaper last-minute Christmas breaks," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer New Year's Eve in the Krkonoše, but there are fewer vacancies.
Another good time for bookings is the first fortnight in February, although bookings for the remaining winter dates tend to be average.
This year, interest in winter breaks is low due to the fact that there is still no snow on the Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if any falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains when there's no snow.
If snow falls on the slopes this week, Christmas will sell out too," says Schiefert.
On the other hand, the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou has seen better bookings this year than last year.
We're up about 5 percent.
We have the last few vacancies for New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There's a lot of interest during the Polish holidays in January and we usually get plenty of bookings in February too," explains the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
The Omnia Hotel, by the central car park in Janské Lázně, is eighty-percent booked up for New Year's Eve.
Yet the newest hotel in Janské Lázně still has half its beds free for Christmas.
January this year has been a nice surprise, as we're already sixty-percent booked up.
So February isn't looking quite so good, but as soon as it snows, then interest in staying in the Krkonoše will definitely rise, says the owner of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
For now, however, the Krkonoše hoteliers will have to wait for heavier falls of snow.
Colder weather is forecast for Thursday, so if anything falls, it should be snow.
But it should get warmer again after that, said Jiří Jakubský of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute in Hradec.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It's almost funny to see how Barack Obama, reputedly the wisest president, is trying so hard in the matter of the Afghan war to repeat the strategy of his predecessor, having himself considered him to be the most foolish.
When he finally came out with his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it appeared that he had made a carbon copy of Bush's Iraq scenario three years earlier.
It's not just that in the text itself he repeatedly uses the words "just like in Iraq", but he even went as far as to use the name of Bush's declaration from January 2007 as the title of his own declaration:"The new way forward".
While three years ago he himself criticised Bush's idea to send fresh troops to help in the beleaguered civil war in Iraq as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which was recommended by his field commanders, was the only possible course of action and so successful that there are no reports in the news about Iraq.
It didn't help Bush's reputation, but in objective terms, it left his successor in a much more favourable position than might be expected.
Barack Obama hopes that, in Afghanistan, the miracle will repeat itself.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by his field commanders, particularly the supreme commander of the Afghan operation General Stanley McChrystal, who even went against the custom of his subordinates to harshly criticise the reluctant gunners in the White House.
He asked for 40 thousand men to turn the situation around.
The president hesitated for three months, but failed to come up with anything better, and so at least the general did out of 10 thousand soldiers.
He managed to squeeze a promise out of Europe for another 5 thousand, even though he himself was originally counting on 10.
The trickiest aspect of Obama's strategy seems to be his plan to start pulling troops out of Afghanistan within 18 months and to finish the process within three years. Obama's doctrine as a whole calls for more questions than it answers.
Many doubt that this half-hearted increase will bear the same fruit as the action plan in Iraq.
Despite the internecine war of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively firm on its feet and its leaders have been honouring the treaties.
The Afghan situation is just the opposite - nobody can be relied upon and no treaties are being upheld.
In these conditions, it is hard for the Afghan security forces to prepare, being so used to changing leaders to suit themselves.
Political institutions, no matter how formally they might be set up, will be nothing more than a Potemkin village in which patriarchal tribal relations will run wild.
Balancing the interests of a variety of ethnic groups is unusually difficult due to the tricky relations between them, a fact which is further complicated by the influence of Pakistan and Iran.
Even building an "operational state", which is the most basic aim of the entire operation, does not seem particularly feasible.
The timing of Obama's strategy is foiled by his voluntarism.
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has just gotten worse and worse, and is now on the verge of exploding.
Only a truly romantic soul, totally unaffected by reality, could believe that the soldiers sent into the turmoil of this war for an "early return home" will bring about any miracles here.
From a political viewpoin,t it is pure irresponsibility setting a date for withdrawing the troops, as the Taliban will see it as indirect acknowledgement of an American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the European people to take part in the operations in Afghanistan is waning.
European politicians cannot and are unwilling to explain to voters what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor which could radically stir things up is what is going on around Iran.
If the situation continues to get worse and increased sanctions against Iran have no effect, the United States will face the difficult question of whether to try to resolve the situation using military force or not.
This will need answering when, according to Obama, America orders the victorious withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan.
Any such solution will obviously also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only saving grace for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three more years to the presidential elections, so there's still enough time for him to come up with another strategyif this one turns out to be a total whitewash.
Managers at Goldman Sachs no longer to receive cash bonuses
The top management of the American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive their bonuses in cash this year.
The announcement came from the company as a reaction to the harsh criticism of their salary policies.
Instead of money, the group of 30 top managers will receive shares, which cannot be sold for another five years.
The shares can also be confiscated if the managers take excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to link Wall Street bonuses with long-term performance.
I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the broader path it has to take, said former investment banker for JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachshas been targeted by critics since it set aside almost 17 billion dollars (almost 300 billion crowns) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
Reuters claims that the total bonuses awarded by the business this year, despite today's announcement, exceeds 20 billion dollars.
High bonuses in the banking sector, what with the economic crisis, have become a political hot potato.
On Wednesday, Britain announced that it had decided to charge a one-off fifty percent tax rate on bankers' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds (around 712,000 CZK).
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women were awarded the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics
In Stockholm today, a record five women received Nobel Prizes from the Swedish king Carl XVI Gustaf in the professional categories and for literature.
In addition to four scientists, they also included the German writer Herta Müller, originally from Romania.
The Nobel Prize for medicine went to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their fellow countryman Jack Szostak, for their research in chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was won by the Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for their work to clarify the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last award was the Nobel Prize for Economics, which went to the Americans Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic management.
The only specialised category which nobody won this year was physics.
Today, this prize was won by the scientists Charles Kao, for his research in optical fibres, and George Smith and Willard Boyle, for inventing the CCD ship, which is the basis for all digital cameras, faxes, and astronomical telescopes.
All the winners received a diploma, the Nobel Medal, and a certificate for a monetary reward.
In each category, this award totals ten million Swedish krona (approximately 25 million CZK).
If there are multiple winners, they share the prize money between them.
Traditionally, the most highly-anticipated award, the Nobel Peace Prize, went to the American president Barack Obama in the Norwegian city of Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged that the award was controversial, as he is just starting out in office and, moreover, heads a country which is currently at war in two countries - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defence of his policy he added, however, that these wars were essential in order to bring about peace, despite the high cost.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invites him to the Castle
On Friday morning, President Václav Klaus will meet with the finance minister Eduard Janota, who is considering resigning as he does not agree with the government's budget for next year as approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is assumed that the budget and also Janota's possible continuation in office will be the topic of Friday's meeting.
The budget has also been criticised by Klaus.
He claims the deficit is too high, which is worsening the public funding crisis.
The meeting was announced by the president's spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to discuss his future on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer.
According to the Budget Act, which Klaus is due to sign, the Czech Republic should get by with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
However, on Wednesday, the House approved the left's proposals to transfer funds, gave state employees a pay rise, and allocated extra money for social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government criticised the social democrats' proposals, saying that they will surreptitiously increase the budget deficit.
A bitter political dispute has broken out between the left on the one hand, and the government, Klaus, and the right on the other, leading to questions about the future of Fischer's interim government, which was agreed on in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as approved by the House, essentially does away with the package of saving measures put into effect by Fischer's government in autumn and which it believes should stop the state falling deeper into debt.
At a breakfast meeting with entrepreneurs today, Klaus, who is behind the state budget law but is not obliged to sign it, declared that politicians have long been neglecting a "serious problem," which is the "unsustainable deficit level" of public finances.
Now, he claims, there is no good solution to this.
The only thing that could improve the situation is a strong government which could fall back on the broader consensus of the political parties, the president says.
ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek said that it was a terrible budget and that the government should rethink continuing in office.
The vice-chairman of the ODS, Petr Nečas, told ČTK that the concept of an interim government supported by the ČSSD, ODS, and the Green Party is evidently no longer working.
In response to this, Premier Fischer described this statement as "strong words."
The head of the ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek by saying that what was terrible was the deficit in the budget prepared by the former Topolánek government for this year, which exceeds 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday the ČSSD declared the approval of next year's budget to be a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's new film
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus will tell the world a lot about their country, its struggle and its victories, despite some people criticising the fact that the main roles are played by American actors.
It is a story about sport, race relations, and Nelson Mandela.
The life of the tireless fighter against the racist system of apartheid in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played by the Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he had asked ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could play him in Eastwood's film.
Another leading role in the film is played by Matt Damon.
I told him: 'If I'm going to play you, I'll need access to you".
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who won an Oscar for his role in Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, has already played roles such as the leader of the anti-slavery movement who eventually himself became a slave, a fictitious president of the USA, and even a god in Evan Almighty, but has only rarely portrayed someone who is still alive and means so much to people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his active role in ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and was then the country's president for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is Latin for 'unconquered' and is the name of a poem by the English writer William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like he does.
The film tells the true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unify the country. The newly-elected President Mandela knows that, after apartheid, his nation will still be racially and economically divided.
He believes that he can unite people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who, to the world, are outsiders.
The South African team eventually makes it through to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story onto the big screen.
My only aim was to play this role as realistically as possible, said Freeman.
Naturally, the greatest challenge was to speak like Mandela.
The actor said that if he and world politicians were in the same ball park, he would try to meet Mandela, go for dinner with him, and be behind the scenes with him before his speeches.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out that when I take your hand, I draw on your energy, it flows into me, and I feel that I know how you are feeling, he said.
For me it's important to try and become a different person.
In the film, Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, which was dominated by white players.
The actor said that he had six months in the tough world of rugby to prepare for the role.
It turned out to be a great surprise for him when he first met Pienaar at his home.
I remember ringing his doorbell, he opened it, and the very first thing I said to François Pienaar was: 'I look much bigger on the screen.'
Despite the evident differences in the stature of the actors compared to their real-life counterparts, under Eastwood's direction, Invictus has received positive reviews and there is even talk of an Oscar nomination.
The Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up the film by saying: "It was a great story, a very well-made film."
In the film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has a 76 percent positive rating.
Secret of the glare over Norway solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
Strange lights of unknown origin have been seen over Norway.
Yesterday the Russian defence ministry finally admitted that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian border.
However, it was another unsuccessful launch and the missile, which is known as "Bulava" and should have been the pride and glory of the Russian army, has gradually turned into a nightmare for the Russian generals and Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence at tests on the rocket has not affected the success rate of the test flights.
The Bulava has generally not lifted off or has been damaged in the air.
The Russian newspapers are describing the "Bulava" as "the flightless rocket."
The rocket that doesn't fly but lights up
This, the 13th test, started off according to plan.
But near the end of the flight there was technical damage to the missile.
Apparently the engine blew up in the rocket's third phase.
This time, the "Bulava" was launched from the atomic submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which was cruising under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of rocket can be launched from a craft which is moving and even submerged.
This makes it likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the malfunctioning "Bulava."
Anyway, the Norwegians never had any doubts that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals are defending themselves this time though, claiming that it can't be described as a total failure.
The first two phases of the rocket went well, and the accident happened during the third stage.
Previously, the engines have always malfunctioned during the first phase.
Even though not one test launch has been completely error-free, the defence ministry consider only six out of the thirteen tests to have been failures.
The generals are optimistic about this almost fifty-percent success rate and keep insisting that the "Bulava" will eventually fly smoothly and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks weighing a total of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signs a year's contract with CSKA Moscow aged 51
The legendary defender Vjačeslav Fetisov will again play a professional ice-hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup holder will help out his team, CSKA Moscow, when they need him, and will evidently be playing in the fifth KHL duel against Saint Petersburg.
Fetisov, who retired at forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
Since Denis Kuljaš was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is training regularly and has agreed to help the team.
We just need to sort out a few formalities, the AP agency quoted the Moscow club coach Sergej Němčinov as saying.
It's not year clear whether or not the famous hockey player's comeback will be for just one match.
I think Fetisov is someone who can boost the morale of the other players, said Němčinov.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice, he will be the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played for Hartford for a whole season at the age of fifty-one and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet of Fetisov, Kasatonov, Makarov, Larionov, and Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players of all time.
In the Soviet Union uniform, he received two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship tiles, and triumphed in the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second half of his career, he also enjoyed success in the NHL, when wearing the Detroit uniform, he twice raised the Stanley Cup over his head.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai obliges unions. All overtime is cut
The management of the Hyundai car plant in Nošovice has agreed with the unions to cut all overtime.
It is because of all this forced overtime that the unions have declared a strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the Hyundai spokesman, Petr Vaněk.
The management, however, wants to come to an agreement with the trade union leaders for one Saturday shift this year.
We can't give up on our production plan, it's essential, so we have proposed voluntary overtime on Saturday December 19th, involving two shifts, said Vaněk.
The website Sedmička.cz wrote that the firm had offered all employees who are to work the Saturday shift a bonus of 400 CZK.
This bonus will also be paid retrospectively to those who worked on Saturday November 28th.
According to Vaněk, the firm has decided to change how it motivates its employees to take the proposed overtime.
Either they'll claim the additional wage for the overtime or they can take time off in lieu on December 28th and extend their Christmas holiday by one day, said Vaněk.
Additionally, all employees working the Saturday shift will have their travel expenses and lunch paid for.
Considering that overtime was the most pressing and thorny question for the unions, as well as for the protesting employees who brought production to such a grinding halt last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to immediately cancel all overtime for December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, virtually every day the car plant workers had been forced to do two hours' overtime on top of their normal eight-hour shifts.
After signing the agreement, the trade unions will call off the strike
Further talks should be held between the car plant management and union leaders on Friday morning.
On Wednesday, the head of the unions, Petr Kuchař, said that if they came to an agreement on the demands and sign the document, they are willing to call off the strike.
The situation at the plant deteriorated sharply last Wednesday when some 400 workers held a spontaneous strike to protest against the incessant overtime.
They were also protesting against bad pay conditions and alleged persecution.
The management responded by saying that employees had to work overtime to meet the demand for cars.
In Monday's announcement of the strike, the unions also asked that no sanctions be imposed against the workers who halted production last Wednesday.
The trade unions are asking the firm to keep overtime to a minimum.
Moreover, this year they are requesting that a 5000 crown bonus be paid for this work.
The Hyundai car plant in Nošovice now employs 2000 people.
The firm began series production last November.
By this September, it had made around 80,000 cars, and its current capacity is 200,000 vehicles a year.
Czech discovery: a substance which works on 'tough' forms of the HIV virus
A team of Czech and German scientists has been testing a new compound which can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of this improved substance is that it also works on viruses which have become immune to medication.
In some cases, this outweighs the fact that the compound used for the normal form of the virus does not have such a strong effect as some drugs that are already available.
No cure has yet been found for AIDS.
Patients' lives can be greatly prolonged by a mixture of drugs which prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body.
However, they have a number of side-effects.
Moreover, if the propagation of the virus is not completely suppressed, it can lead to the development of resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work being done by experts from three institutions, the Czech Academy of Sciences, VŠCHT Prague, and the University of Heidelberg, is opening up the way to deal with the rthe virus' resistance.
They have shown that substances known as metallacarboranes act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
Metallacarboranes are a compound of boron, hydrogen, carbon, and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way to all the other drugs in use today, and so they may get over the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists are coming up with new ‘improved’ compounds, prepared using knowledge of the molecular mechanism and its relation to the virus protein.
Metallacarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected to a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and hardy virus
The HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential to the life-cycle of the virus.
The mature infectious viral corpuscles would not occur if the HIV virus was not split by the HIV protease.
If we can stop the HIV protease, we will also stop the virus from spreading through the patient's body, the scientists explained in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of compounds in which there are two pairs of cages (see the diagram) connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
Somewhat weaker, but more reliable
The effectiveness of this series of substances against the HIV protease has been tested in a test-tube, as well as its effectiveness against the more immune(resistant) strain as acquired from patients infected with the HIV virus.
The effect of metallacarboranes on the normal strain of the enzyme is not as strong as that of drugs used in clinical practice, although their effect is not diminished against the resistant strains, whereas drugs currently used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of the effect and also of its other properties, such as its biological and chemical stability, low toxicity, and the possibility of making other chemical modifications, make metallacarboranes an interesting compound for future research aimed at suggesting new effective drugs to combat HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Structural Biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fall-out over the budget. ODS attacks Fischer, who defends himself
The head of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek, described the next year's approved budget as "terrible" and said that Premier Jan Fischer's government should seriously rethink its position in office.
The government chairman described the ODS statement as strong words.
Apparently he will take some time to think about it.
The vice-chairman of the ODS, Petr Nečas, said that the concept of an interim government supported by the ČSSD, ODS, and Green Party, was evidently no longer working.
According to Nečas, the government chairman must decide if he intends to fall back on the minority in the House as a fight against the growing deficit, or if he is to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approaches taken by the ODS and social democrats on the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed, remarked Nečas.
On Wednesday, the House accepted the budget for 2010, naturally with the left's proposed amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House gave extra money for the salaries of state employees, for social services, and for direct payments to farmers.
he government criticised the social democrats' proposals, saying that they will surreptitiously increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should get by with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
Before the vote, the ODS left the room, complying with the government's wishes that the amended budget is not as poor an option as the provisional budget.
Disappointment and futility
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his feeling of disappointment and futility, while Premier Jan Fischer said that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota were to really threaten to resign should the proposed amendments be accepted, the situation would look completely different.
According to Czech Television, Janota has made an appointment to see the Prime Minister on Monday after the session.
At the same time, he indicated that he was rethinking his position in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment in the budget talks.
If Fischer commits himself to continuing the fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the ČSSD appointees who carried through the budget amendments have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly state that he will hand in his resignation if the House approves other laws that will increase the deficit, those relating to sick pay, pensions, or the amendment to the Civil Servants Act for example.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed to the ODS have committed no offence
This is a matter for the ministerial chairman Fischer and the government as a whole.
Ministers appointed to the ODS have done nothing wrong, stressed Topolánek in a text report from the USA.
He pointed out that several ministries employ people in under-secretary positions who support TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas emphasised that, if Fischer were to decide to resign on the principle of the fight against the public finances deficit, "it is totally logical and correct that he falls back on the left majority currently in the House."
But then he would not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the civil democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and I'll concentrate on that when the time comes, defence minister Martin Barták told reporters in the House, having been elected by the civil democrats.
This afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels to attend a European Council meeting.
ODS stands down at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas also stressed that, on Wednesday in the House, the ODS would evidently have voted against the amended budget if the Prime Minister had not explicitly asked the civil democrats to allow the budget to be approved.
We don't look like orphans, we're not little children, was how he reacted to the question of whether the ODS was not hampered by the presence of the party chairman in the parliament and in the Czech Republic during the political negotiations regarding the budget.
I didn't notice that my vote was missing.
Back when I renounced my mandate, I knew that the following months would see the Bolshevisation of the House and the destruction of all that is positive, Topolánek himself responded.
The new Czech Railways timetable shows that fewer trains will be running for almost the same fares
From December 13th, Czech Railways will be cancelling or restricting some less frequented express and local trains, but will be adding more services to other lines.
As of the day the new timetable comes into force, there will be two percent fewer services in comparison with now.
Most fares, including basic and special tickets, will stay the same.
More links to the capital will be available, for example, to the people in the Ostrava region, as the railways are adding one Pendolino to that line.
However, the express will stop running to Bratislava.
There will be fewer express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route, and the direct service from Prague - Letohrad will be cut dramatically.
The region planning the greatest transport cuts is the Region of Hradec Králové, with a total cut of eight percent, although Prague and the surrounding area can expect to see a rise.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also being cut, and several express services on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route will be reduced to just a few days a week.
One of the greatest changes is the introduction of the new direct line from Milovice to Prague, since people now travelling from Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line in the Esko suburban system, which can now be opened since the track from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice has been fully electrified.
Long-distance services to the capital will end at the Prague Hlavní nádraží station.
Czech Railways is introducing more Pendolino routes between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run on two-hour intervals.
From December 13th, passengers will no longer be able to take Pendolino to Bratislava.
This year's cost of regional railways: 200 million more
Express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, and next year it will give the railways four billion crowns to cover demonstrable losses, the same amount as this year. Local trains are ordered by the regional authorities, who, next year, will pay out a total of eight billion crowns for them, while almost three billion will be contributed by the state.
This year, regional trains are costing 200 million more.
Czech Railways have concluded a new ten-year contract for local and express trains, whereas, previously, the contract was always for one year.
The railways have praised the system, despite the fact that the great majority of fares have not been increased.
The only changes are to ČD Net one-day network tickets and eLiška cheap internet tickets.
Travellers without a customer card will find that the ČD Net price has increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The eLiška price will now depend on the distance travelled, whereas, previously, it was a flat rate of 160 crowns to travel between any regional cities.
Filipino gunmen still holding more than 50 people, Children have been released
Today, gunmen in the south of the Philippines kidnapped 75 people, including several primary school students and their teachers.
This from the AFP agency, which originally announced only 65 abductees.
All 17 of the captured children, together with their teacher, were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping happened in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Around 19 gunmen are apparently using the hostages as a human shield in their escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to arrange the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the gunmen are part of the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police had originally been chasing the kidnappers following violence that occurred as accounts were settled between two local family clans.
In the province of Maguindanao, in the south of the Philippines, martial law has been declared due to the recent massacre which left 57 people dead.
The victims of the massacre on November 23rd, which was related to the elections for governor, included 30 reporters.
The governor of this southern Filipino province has been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, together with his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao.
But on Tuesday, these separatists renewed peace talks with the Filipino government.
The story of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Invictus by Clint Eastwood will hit American cinemas, depicting part of the life of the former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous opponent of apartheid is taken on by Morgan Freeman, who was apparently chosen years ago by Mandela himself for his talent.
The supporting male role of the legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar is played by Matt Damon.
With the film in cinemas critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18th, 1918 in Mvez, in South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 received the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
There were great expectations, as he appeared in public at a time when not only was South Africa busy preparing for the football world championship, but the media was also rife with worrying news about increasing racial hatred and discrimination by the black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the response to the new film has so far been generally positive in South Africa, despite the number of objections to "brat-pack" Hollywood stars being cast in the main roles.
However, despite what he says, Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I had dreamt about this role for many years and prepared for it well.
I met Nelson Mandela many times to, as they say, draw on his energy, he said in an interview after the film's grand premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good that we can commemorate Mandela and his mission in a film.
It is a story about South Africa, but it affects everybody, he added.
In the national rugby team uniform
The film, based on the book by the British writer John Carlin, entitled Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation, portrays the South African human rights activist during his first presidential election campaign.
In the film, Morgan Freeman tries to unite the two races and the populations that had so long been segregated and, like Nelson Mandela did in 1995, appears in the film in the South African national rugby uniform at the world cup match, which was won by South Africa.
For appearing in the kit, which is an almost sacred symbol in South Africa, fourteen years ago, Mandela received a standing ovation from the predominantly white spectators and gained the esteem of the white people.
Perhaps a football championship can actually bring people together as one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only black person on the national team.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve is only now becoming apparent.
White South Africans, however, are sceptical, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to go to Britain, admitted in a recent interview for LN.
The championship begins on June 11th, 2010.
Transformer worth tens of millions of crowns burns in Louny region
In the morning, a fire broke out in a transformer owned by Čeps at the switching station in the village of Výškov, near Louny.
Six fire engines came out to fight the fire, said the spokesman for the Ústí regional firefighters, Lukáš Marvan.
Originally, the firefighters wanted to let the transformer burn, but later changed their minds and are putting the fire out using a mix of water, foam, and special fire-suppression agents.
The fire was caused by a technical fault, a short circuit inside the transformer.
Nobody was hurt, and according to company spokesperson Pavla Mandátová, the incident will not hinder the safe operation of the distribution station.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, although the exact figure will not be known until the fire has been extinguished.
Mandátová says that the ruined transformer will have to be replaced with a new one.
She added that nothing like this had ever happened in the ten years that Čeps has been operating, and this kind of fault was a one-off.
According to ČEZ spokeswoman for northern Bohemia, Sonia Holingerová Hendrychová, there were no power cuts and households, offices and companies were not affected by the transformer fire.
In the Czech Republic, the joint stock company Čeps is the exclusive operator of transmission systems and 400 kV and 220 kV power lines.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 switching stations with 67 transformers converting electricity from the transmission system to the distribution system, as well as 4339 kilometres of power lines.
Jančura files a slander suit against three ČSSD commissioners
The owner of Student Agency, Radim Jančura, will today file a slander suit against three social democrat commissioners.
These are Michal Hašek, commissioner for South Moravia, Radko Martínek, commissioner for Pardubice, and Olomouc commissioner Martin Tesařík.
Jančura announced this in the Twenty Minutes programme on Radiožurnál.
The suit relates to the company's attempts to operate regional trains in certain regions.
However, all the regions eventually signed a long-term contract with Czech Railways.
So now all three commissioners are attacking us and saying that we're getting the best out of it, while the offer we put forward was just what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we're more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, as we know the Czech Railways prices that were concluded last week.
So all we can do is defend ourselves.
It's for slander against Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
He also said that he has proof from all the regional authorities that they did not act in accordance with European law.
He is therefore preparing a motion for the European Commission.
Hašek sees the suit as a further continuation of Mr Jančura's great media show, which works as a free advertisement for himself and his company.
It's understandable that I'm prepared to defend my good name and that of my region, and I call upon the other commissioners to do the same.
I expect that this matter will clearly show that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating the public over regional rail transport and using lies and false arguments, said Hašek.
Last week, Jančura said that he is investing several million crowns in advertising to draw attention to these inappropriate actions taken by the regional authorities.
He told Radiožurnál that he was halting the campaign for Christmas and would restart it in the New Year.
He specified that the campaign would fight corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions decided to operate regional rail links with Czech Railways and had not announced tenders for the order, worth around 150 billion crowns.
According to Jančura this is illegal and in contravention of the principles of the European Court of Justice.
Jančura claims that his criticism of regional rail transport has already led to his being threatened by a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we don't stop this, we could lose our bus licence.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know who it was but I'm not going to say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Vaccinations against pneumococcus will be free and voluntary.
Starting January, vaccinations against pneumococcus will radically change ingrained habits.
These should be the first free yet voluntary vaccinations for families.
But some are saying that compulsory vaccinations would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free anti-pneumococcus vaccinations are reaching a peak.
The pharmaceutical institute is already setting the maximum price for vaccines to be paid for by health insurance companies.
Experts are now clear on how to proceed with the vaccinations.
New vaccinations
Vaccines free of charge for children born in August
Starting January, there could be free anti-pneumococcus vaccinations for children born on or after August 2nd.
The condition is that they have not received any prior vaccinations.
Anyone who began to be vaccinated last year or earlier will have to pay for any later re-vaccinations.
The first batch of vaccinations must be given when the child is between 3 and 5 months old.
Last year, one in four families had their children voluntarily vaccinated against pneumococcus.
Parents paid 1600 crowns or more per vaccination.
The youngest children require four vaccinations.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year on vaccinations.
But they save on the treatment that unvaccinated children would otherwise need.
So far, the state has been paying around 500 thousand crowns a year on all general vaccinations for children.
Subsidised vaccinations were introduced as part of the Janota package.
Pneumococcus causes infections of the middle ear, but also serious infections of the cerebral membranes and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections claim the lives of up to 28 children under the age of ten every year, according to hospital figures.
Besides the Czech Republic, around 40 countries have introduced general anti-pneumococcus vaccinations for children.
Will vaccinations be compulsory?
Some believe that in the future these vaccinations could be compulsory.
As of January, they should be paid for by the insurance companies and not compulsory.
The head of the Nahlas civil association, Rudolf Kalovský, says that compulsory vaccinations would be better.
His association has long been promoting pneumococcus vaccines.
The specialists at the international conference that our association attended were not very happy to hear that we have voluntary vaccinations.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we're happy that we managed to get at least these voluntary vaccinations in place.
I think this is the route we have to take, said Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcus vaccination system.
We're not considering it at this time, said ministry spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccinations have their drawbacks, say doctors
The chairwoman of the Professional Society of Paediatricians, Hana Cabrnochová, acknowledges that voluntary vaccinations have their drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, the number of revaccinations could then be cut. "With vaccines costing so much, we can understand the political decision that vaccinations should be offered on a voluntary basis," says Cabrnochová.
Experts assume that, starting next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their babies vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The anti-pneumococcus vaccinations are a milestone in that they are the first general vaccinations for children to be paid for by the insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should fund prevention to save money on later treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy vaccines themselves
However, practising paediatricians are concerned when it comes to buying the vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines would be purchased by the insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state issues drugs for other vaccinations.
Some ministers, however, are worried that the insurance companies could "run wild with health insurance funds".
So doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until the insurance companies refund the money.
It is estimated that practising paediatricians will have to spend 40 thousand a month on vaccines, which is a lot of money.
It certainly won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
US artist's son 'in museum theft'
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta, has been charged with trying to steal paintings worth $20m (£12m) from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
They say Mr Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr Frazetta Snr, aged 81, is famed for his depiction of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
