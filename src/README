                                            == Kriya - README ==

Kriya:
------
Kriya is an implementation of hierarchical phrase-based translation model. It is implemented in Python (2.6 or 2.7) and includes
Hiero-style grammar extractor as well as decoder.


Environment variables:
----------------------
Kriya expects the following special environment variable to be set.

KRIYA_DIR       - Top-level directory leading to phrase-extractor and decoder (eg. '/users/baskaran/Research/git/Kriya')

The following environment variables are required during training process:

GIZA_DIR        - Directory containing the Giza++ binaries
MOSES_DIR       - Moses bin directory containing executables such as extract (used for extracting phrase alignments)
SCRIPTS_ROOTDIR - Scripts directory of the Moses installation (required for running training steps)

The Kriya tuning script expects the following environment variables to be set for the decoding/tuning steps.

NGRAM_SWIG_KENLM    - Path to the Python wrapper for KenLM (eg. '$KRIYA_DIR/Kriya-Decoder/wrapper-kenlm')
NGRAM_SWIG_SRILM    - Path to the Python wrapper for SRILM (eg. '$KRIYA_DIR/Kriya-Decoder/wrapper-srilm')

MEGAM_DIR           - Path containing megam binary (required for PRO tuning)
SVMRANK_DIR         - Path containing svmrank binary (required for PRO tuning)
TER_JAR             - Full path of the tercom jar file (reqd. by PRO for tuning with TER)
METEOR_JAR          - Full path of the meteor jar file (reqd. by PRO for tuning with METEOR)

JAVA_HOME           - Expects to find java under $JAVA_HOME/bin (required by PRO for tuning w/ METEOR & TER)
PL_HOME             - Expects to find perl under $PL_HOME/bin
PY3_HOME            - Expects to find Python-3 under $PY3_HOME/bin (required by PRO for tuning with RIBES metric)


Acknowledgements:
-----------------
* The perl scripts that are concerned with the tuning step are originally from the corresponding Moses scripts. We modified them
    for Kriya to support the generic high-performance clusters and also extended the script to support tuning with PRO.

* The script for computing BLEU score is taken from MOSES (multi-bleu.perl) with minor modifications. We modified this separately
    to compute sentence-level BLEU (BLEU+1) scores (multi-sent-bleu.perl) as explained in Lin and Och (2004). 

* RIBES (Isozaki etal., 2010) evaluation metric was conceived and implemented by the research group in NTT in Japan. The script
    for computing RIBES scores (for tuning and evaluation) is obtained from http://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/icl/lirg/ribes/ and is
    distributed with Kriya 'as is'.


Questions?
----------
We realize that the documentation for Kriya is far from complete and we'll be glad to answer questions if you need some help.
